Write a program that prints out to the console the numbers from 3 to 7 (including both 3 and 7). Use a while loop. If you accidentally write a program that doesn't stop, press ctrl-c
Modify the program to also print out the sum of the numbers from 3 to 7 at the end

3
4
5
6
7
total: 25

let currentNumber = 3;
sum = 0
        while (count <= 7) {
            console.log(currentNUmber +1);
                currentNumber = currentNumber +1;
             
        } 
console.log ("total:, sum);

// I understand how i can use sum on its own but not in a function combined with others. 
// var a = 3; 
// var b = 4; 
// etc
// var c = a + b;
